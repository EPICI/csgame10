# csgame10
Contingency by Rudy Li and Faith Lum, 2017. For (Mr.Cope's) ICS2O1 summative project.

Run
=
Try `main.py` first. If it does not work, it is due to an OS related issue. Run `engine.jar` directly instead. This is guaranteed to start up the game.

No installation is needed.

Documentation
=
Docstrings can be found in the source.

Files
=
All files, except the Jython library, are in the same folder, because of permissions - the program is only allowed to (by default) access files in its own directory.

`engine.jar` is the engine. `main.py` is the game. All resources are left in their original formats, with animations as `png` sequences.
